# QR_Code_Generator

Quick Response (QR) codes have become an integral tool for transferring information quickly and conveniently. This project aims to develop a QR code generation API service using Node.js and Express.js.

Quick Response (QR) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store significantly more information than traditional one-dimensional barcodes. They work by encoding data—such as text, URLs, or contact information—into a binary format. An error-correcting method adds extra bits to ensure the data can be recovered even if parts of the code are damaged. QR code readers, including smartphone cameras, detect patterns to interpret the data and correct errors, ultimately revealing the original information.
